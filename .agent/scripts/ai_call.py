"""ai_call.py -- one backend-agnostic way to ask a model for text.

Three places in this harness used to shell out to `claude` directly, each with
its own copy of a `_claude_bin()` that RAISED when the binary was missing:
command_queue.py (triage + worker spawn), dashboard/server.py (/api/ai-task),
and evals/run_behavioral.py. On a machine without Claude Code installed --
which is now a supported configuration, see .agent/scripts/harness_config.py --
those three died instead of degrading, and two of them run on cron.

This module is the single resolver. It does NOT invent a protocol: it reuses the
fallback contract .agent/skills/agy-bridge/run.py already defines and nine
callers already honour.

    exit 0  -> stdout is the answer
    exit 3  -> stdout is {"status":"fallback_to_claude","claude_fallback":"<tier>"}
               and the caller MUST honour it (retry on Claude, or report clearly)

Routing, cheapest correct answer first:
  1. A usable claude binary -> run Claude. This is today's behaviour, byte for
     byte, so a machine that has Claude sees no change at all.
  2. No Claude, agy-bridge present -> run agy-bridge, which walks its own backend
     chain and emits the same sentinel if every backend fails.
  3. Neither -> emit the sentinel ourselves and exit 3. Never a bare exception.

Two shapes, because the callers need two different things:
  plan()  returns the argv to run, for callers that spawn DETACHED workers and
          need to build their own `sh -c` sentinel wrapper.
  run()   executes synchronously and hands back (ok, text, meta).

Usage:
  python3 .agent/scripts/ai_call.py --task ping                  # smoke test
  python3 .agent/scripts/ai_call.py --task harvest --prompt-file x.txt
  python3 .agent/scripts/ai_call.py --task draft --prompt "..." --plan

               number or it kills the bridge before the exit-3 sentinel is printed.
               See parent_timeout().

    Callers that spawn detached workers use argv and build their own sentinel
    wrapper; callers that just want an answer use run() below.

    allowed_tools is a Claude-only concept. Under agy the bridge runs the model
    with --sandbox and NO tool access at all (see run_agy in
    .agent/skills/agy-bridge/run.py, which always appends --sandbox). For a prompt
    that merely wants tools RESTRICTED that is strictly safer, so it is dropped
    silently and the call proceeds.

    require_tools=True secondarys that judgement: it says the prompt cannot be
    satisfied WITHOUT tools, typically because it instructs the model to write its
    output to a file. Dropping allowed_tools there does not make the run safer, it
    makes it impossible, and the model still exits 0 having produced nothing. That
    combination resolves to backend "none" so the caller refuses it at plan time
    instead of dispatching a worker that can only fail silently. There is no
    tool-capable non-Claude backend to fall back to today; when one is added, route
    to it here rather than relaxing this gate.
